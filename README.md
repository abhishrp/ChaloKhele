This is a project to develop a mobile application (android and/or iOS) that will assist group of enthusiasts to come together and play the games they like. 

The basic aim of the app will be to broadcast in your close vicinity a notice that you and your friend are starting some XYZ game and whoever is interested may join. The broadcast message will then be received by individuals currently in the neighbourhood who have already showed a liking for the same XYZ game. The recipients of this message can respond whether they are going to join the XYZ game.

##Use Cases:
1. **Football** (as the world calls it, but for american reader its called 'Soccer'):
  a)  Lets say, a few friends decided to go out and play football. They may or may not have all the necessary equipments.   However the problem here is that they are few in number, say 4. Its no fun playing football in teams of 2. They would like others in the neighbourhood to join them. They would not know who is interested in the game. This will be easy now with the help of this app. All they have to do is open the app, and broadcast a message by just clicking 1 button. Their message will contains a) the game they are playing, b) the current count(this can be updated in real time), c) the location and 4) equipments available (they have the football to play with or not). This message will be received by all the app users in the neighbourhood who have previously chosen football as a game they want to play. They will have a choice to accept or reject the invite. Thus increasing the count if accepted. More the accepts, more the count, more is the fun.

  b) **Bring others along**:
  If the recipient of the message accepts the message, he can also specify that he will be bringing N number of people (non-app users) along with him. 
  
  c) **Bring equipment**:
  If the broadcaster is lacking some equipment, he can request invite acceptors to bring the equipments if they have it. For example, the broadcaster dont have goal-post. However one of the acceptor has it. He can notify accordingly and bring it along. This game has become really exciting now.
  
  d) **Rating**:
  How about some anonymous rating of the people you played with today? Player will be able to rate each other about their game play as novice/mediocre/expert/mentor. This rating will be anonymous since we don't want people fighting on the play ground because someone rated him lower than he expects.
  
  e) **Pick and choose**:
  Now how about selective broadcast. Hmmm.. seem like an advanced app. This will be a paid feature, in which you can broadcast about the game to people with certain rating. So expert can play a professional game with other experts with being dragged by novice players.


2) Using the App:
  a) The first step is to install the app on an android or ios device.
  b) On first startup, the user will be prompted for some info in order to create a profile of that individual. The infomation asked may contain name, address or location (home address prefered), age, sex, picture, phone(optional), link to social media profiles(like fb, instagram, google+, etc)(optional), etc.
  c) Now the most important part. Selection of games they would like to play in the neighborhood. User will be able to give preference to some games over other, basically ranking the games and also specify their proficiency in each game(amature, beginner, mediocre, expert, professional, mentor).  Also the time availibility, the radius in which they are looking to play, the equipments they can bring in(optional), etc.
  d) The next step is modes of notification, popup, sms(optional), email(optional), social media(optional).
  e) Once the profile is complete the user can now see a map of the neighborhood and see what game is in progress in which location. The games will be visible as markers. Only games that the user showed interest will be visible.
  f) The user can now choose a marker and notify that you are interested to join the game. This is the manual search method.
  g) The user does not always have to check the map for the games in progress. Whenever a game of his/her interest is commencing in his/her neighborhood, the user will recieve a popup notification(similar to a new message notification) saying that a particular game is commencing at a certain location.
  h) The user may choose to open the notification which will open the app or he/she may dismiss the notification.
  i) If the user chose to open the notification, the app will open with a dialog box.
  j) The dialog box will contain detailed information about the game. It will contain the type of game, where it is going to be played, how many players are joining, what all equipments they have, etc. 
  k) The user get a choice to join the game or dismiss the dialog box.
  l) If the user decides to join, he/she can also specify if he/she will be bring along other people or any missing or extra equipments.
  m) And the game begins. Strangers meet and play games togeter.
  n) Once the game ends, everyone can see others profile.
  o) Now this app can be used as a social media app. Players can add each other as friends, chat, share images and videos, etc.
  p) Also they can rate each other on their game play. However this rating will be private. The person rated will not see what he is being rated as. This rating will be visible in the notification talked about in j).
