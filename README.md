This is a project to develop a mobile application (android and/or iOS) that will assist group of enthusiasts to come together and play the games they like. 

The basic aim of the app will be to broadcast in your close vicinity a notice that you and your friend are starting some XYZ game and whoever is interested may join. The broadcast message will then be received by individuals currently in the neighbourhood who have already showed a liking for the same XYZ game. The recipients of this message can respond whether they are going to join the XYZ game.

Use Cases:
1) Football (as the world calls it, but for american reader 'Soccer'):
  Lets say, a few friends decided to go out and play football. They have all the necessary equipments. However they are few in number, say 4. Its no fun playing football in teams of 2. They would like others in the neighbourhood to join them. They would not know who is interested in the game. This will be easy now. All they have to do is open the app, and broadcast a message by just clicking 1 button. They message will contains a) the game they are playing, b) the current count(this can be updated in real time), c) the location and 4) equipments available (they have the ball to play with or not). This message will be received by all the app users in the neighbourhood. They will have a choice to accept or reject the invite. Thus increasing the count if accepted. More the accepts, more the count, more is the fun.
  
2) Bring others along:
  If the recipient of the message accepts the message, he can also specify that he will be bringing N number of people (non-app users) along with him. 
  
3) Bring equipment:
  If the broadcaster is lacking some equipment, he can request invite acceptors to bring the equipments if they have it. For example, the broadcaster dont have goal-post. However one of the acceptor has it. He can notify accordingly and bring it along. This game has become really exciting now.
  
4) Rating:
  How about some anonymous rating of the people you played with today? Player will be able to rate each other about their game play as novice/mediocre/expert/mentor. This rating will be anonymous since we don't want people fighting on the play ground because someone rated him lower than he expects.
  
5) Pick and choose:
  Now how about selective broadcast. Hmmm.. seem like an advanced app. This will be a paid feature, in which you can broadcast about the game to people with certain rating. So expert can play a professional game with other experts with being dragged by novice players.
